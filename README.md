TIME TRAILS & BOG APP

*********************************

Bog app is a way to build an express server underneath a powerful and dynamic react app. 

Time trials intorduces the idea of building out an express/react full-stack application in a timed environment. The idea is to get bettr each time around and get faster with it until I bcome a coding demi-god. 


My thoughts initially: Im a little worried about the express aspect but since project two I have beome slightly more comfortable with express and the idea in general of fullstack web development. I think with some practice, I will become a lot more comfortable with back end devlopent. 

a 3-5 sentences reflection on how this went for you:

This was really helpful,and as I told Jamie, I
will continue using the bog-app setup to help
with  the set up pf MERN stacks. I dealt with a funeral this weekend so I wasn't able to practice this to the fullest potential but after completion of this project, I will be using the bog-app to complete many more reps building a MERN stack. I have gotten faster with building MERNs. 

a tip for others to help conquer some part of the app that used to trip you up
the times for your first and fourth runs:

A tip for conquering the MERN stack; for me, when I struggle with say, an App.js or routes or whatever I literally will type the entire thing out, and then erase it. I will fill the entire page out, and top to bottom and then erase it all and do it agian until I have it mostly memorized. to me, this is about 30% comprehension, and 70% memorization.
