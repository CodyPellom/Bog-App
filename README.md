TIME TRAILS & BOG APP

*********************************

Bog app is a way to build an express server underneath a powerful and dynamic react app. 

Time trials intorduces the idea of building out an express/react full-stack application in a timed environment. The idea is to get bettr each time around and get faster with it until I bcome a coding demi-god. 


My thoughts initially: Im a little worried about the express aspect but since project two I have beome slightly more comfortable with express and the idea in general of fullstack web development. I think with some practice, I will become a lot more comfortable with back end devlopent.
